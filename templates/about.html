            <h3>🎯 Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
                At DepHNN, our mission is to advance the integration of artificial intelligence in the field of mental health by developing reliable and data-driven tools for the early detection of depression.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through the analysis of EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals, we aim to identify neural patterns that may indicate depressive disorders. Our goal is to provide clinicians and researchers with a supportive, AI-powered solution that enables faster, more objective, and evidence-based screening for mental health conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are deeply committed to fostering innovation in healthcare while ensuring that technology is applied ethically, responsibly, and empathetically—always keeping the well-being of individuals at the center of our mission.
            </p>
            
            <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">💻 The Technology</h3>
            <p>
                DepHNN employs a hybrid neural network model that combines the strengths of multiple deep learning architectures to analyze EEG data with exceptional precision.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system is designed to capture both spatial and temporal features from brainwave patterns, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of depression classification.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our web-based platform empowers users to seamlessly upload EEG recordings, visualize analytical results, and receive AI-driven insights in real time, providing a user-friendly experience for both clinicians and researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Built using Python, TensorFlow, and Django, DepHNN ensures a high standard of scalability, security, and computational efficiency, making it suitable for both research and clinical applications.
            </p>
